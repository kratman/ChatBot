### Purpose

This directory stores the information that GabbieBot has learned from users.
The files are created when GabbieBot is trained with books, and updated when
GabbieBot interacts with users.

### Formats

The memory files are created by writing the dictionaries and arrays to a file
in a format that is easy to read at run time.
