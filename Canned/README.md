### Purpose

Canned statement-response pairs can be used to supply default knowledge to
GabbieBot. These files are not designed to be edited by users. These files
should be treated as part of the source code.

### Formats

The statemet-response pairs are formatted with keywords. For example:
```
user_statement: Hello.
gabbie_responce: Greetings.
```
This pair will cause GabbieBot to respond to a user saying "Hello" with a
response of "Greetings".
