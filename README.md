### Build tests

Coming soon...

### Introduction

Gabbie is a simple artifical intelligence (i.e. a chat bot) for learning
and teaching machine learning techniques.

### Installation

Coming soon...

### Training

Gabbie can be taught to speak using plain text books and lists of canned
responses. Gabbie will also learn as users interact with her; through
conversations or by playing twenty questions.

After training, Gabbie's memories are stored in the Knowledge directory.
Gabbie can be forced to forget by running the "Forget.bash" script or by
removing the memory text files.
