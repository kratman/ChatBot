### Purpose

This directory is designed to store plain text books, articles, and other
materials for training GabbieBot.

### Formats

The training routines for GabbieBot can only read plain text files. Everything
in the text file will be treated as part of a sentence. For this reason, extra
text, URLs, and other unneeded information should be removed before training
GabbieBot.
